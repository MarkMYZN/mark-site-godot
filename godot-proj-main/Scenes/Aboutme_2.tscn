text = "I chose to pursue Computer Science because it’s the closest path to my primary goal: joining a cybersecurity team. My passion for programming comes from a strong problem-solving mindset—I enjoy tackling challenges and experimenting with possibilities, always asking myself, “What if I did this, and what would be the result?”

This curiosity began at an early age. At 8 years old, I was constantly tinkering with electronics—sometimes even breaking them—just to understand how they worked. My fascination also grew from watching movies and TV shows that portrayed hackers skillfully navigating systems and databases. While I’ve since learned that hacking in real life is far less glamorous than in the movies, those early impressions planted the seed that continues to drive my interest in technology and cybersecurity today."
